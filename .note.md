I'll create a simpler script that runs both services without using tmux, just running them silently in the background.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# filepath: /home/jzhang-l/WorkDir/MixTex-OCR-WebRebuild/start_app.sh

echo "Starting MixTex-OCR Web Application..."

# Store project root directory
PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd)

# Create logs directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p logs

# Start backend service
echo "Starting backend service..."
cd "$PROJECT_ROOT/webapi" 
nohup uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload > "$PROJECT_ROOT/logs/backend.log" 2>&1 &
BACKEND_PID=$!
echo "Backend service started with PID: $BACKEND_PID"

# Start frontend service
echo "Starting frontend service..."
cd "$PROJECT_ROOT/web-frontend"
nohup npm run dev > "$PROJECT_ROOT/logs/frontend.log" 2>&1 &
FRONTEND_PID=$!
echo "Frontend service started with PID: $FRONTEND_PID"

# Save PIDs for later use
echo "$BACKEND_PID" > "$PROJECT_ROOT/logs/backend.pid"
echo "$FRONTEND_PID" > "$PROJECT_ROOT/logs/frontend.pid"

# Wait for services to start up
sleep 2

echo "Both services are now running in the background."
echo "Backend logs: $PROJECT_ROOT/logs/backend.log"
echo "Frontend logs: $PROJECT_ROOT/logs/frontend.log"
echo ""
echo "To stop the services, run: ./stop_app.sh"

# Create a stop script
cat > "$PROJECT_ROOT/stop_app.sh" << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd)

echo "Stopping MixTex-OCR Web Application..."

if [ -f "$PROJECT_ROOT/logs/backend.pid" ]; then
    BACKEND_PID=$(cat "$PROJECT_ROOT/logs/backend.pid")
    echo "Stopping backend service (PID: $BACKEND_PID)..."
    kill -15 $BACKEND_PID 2>/dev/null || echo "Backend process was not running"
    rm "$PROJECT_ROOT/logs/backend.pid"
fi

if [ -f "$PROJECT_ROOT/logs/frontend.pid" ]; then
    FRONTEND_PID=$(cat "$PROJECT_ROOT/logs/frontend.pid")
    echo "Stopping frontend service (PID: $FRONTEND_PID)..."
    kill -15 $FRONTEND_PID 2>/dev/null || echo "Frontend process was not running"
    rm "$PROJECT_ROOT/logs/frontend.pid"
fi

echo "All services stopped."
EOF

chmod +x "$PROJECT_ROOT/stop_app.sh"

echo "The frontend should be available at http://localhost:3000"
echo "The backend API should be available at http://localhost:8000"
```

To use this script:

1. Save it as `start_app.sh` in the root directory of your project
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x start_app.sh
   ```
3. Run it:
   ```bash
   ./start_app.sh
   ```

This script:
- Starts both services silently in the background using `nohup`
- Redirects output to log files in a `logs` directory
- Saves the process IDs for easy stopping later
- Creates a complementary `stop_app.sh` script to properly terminate the services
- No need for tmux or other terminal multiplexers

You can check the logs at any time by viewing the log files:
```bash
tail -f logs/backend.log
tail -f logs/frontend.log
```
